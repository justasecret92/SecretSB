welcome to this repo.


Info About The Selfbot :

#its open source btw


It has 5 commands but 1 could be very useful, you can leave it open and
you can purge all your messages by typing "beam"

Sadly, discord rate limited this, meaning the speed will not be the same
it will get the job done, but before it would do it at a insane speed.


to setup this selfbot is the very easy. You need to CD in the file or 
open cmd from the file. when you cd into the file  you need to
run "pip install -r requirements.txt" and the installation of the req
uired modules will continue.

Open the file in your favourite text editor and on the last line paste
your discord token.

put ur discord token and simply run the python file and it should work

enjoy this repo, Enkeli esht robqir!
